# Development Guidelines

This repository includes all of our internal Development Guidelines at Steadfast Collective, covering topics like [Statamic](./statamic.md), [Laravel](#) and our [Accessibility Guidelines](#).

We update our guidelines regularly to ensure we're taking advantage of best practices.

## Updating Guidelines

Anyone can make changes to our Developer Guidelines.

Changes should be made directly on GitHub. You should open a pull request and request a review from the relevant person. Once a change has been merged, it will automatically be synced to Outline.
