# Development Guidelines

This repository includes some of our internal Developer Guidelines at Steadfast Collective. We update our guidelines regularly to ensure we're taking advantage of best practices.

## Guidelines

## Updating Guidelines

Anyone can make changes to our Developer Guidelines.

Changes should be made directly on GitHub. You should open a pull request and request a review from the relevant person. Once the PR has been merged, it will automatically be synced to Outline (our internal wiki).
